# ImageCropEdiorView

ImageCropEdiorView supports below features:
1. Pinch to change the size of the select area.
2. Move to change the position of the select area.
3. Move vertices of the select area to change its size.

> Note: The above three operations will not allow the four vertices to exceed the boundaries of the View, and the selected area has a minimum size constraint, which is that both the width and height cannot be less than 50 at the same time, and each side cannot be smaller than 20.
